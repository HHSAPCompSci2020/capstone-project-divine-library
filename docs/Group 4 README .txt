3. Click “+” to add members, click “-” to delete members
 
Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:
[These are features that we agree you will definitely have by the project due date. A good final project would have all of these completed. At least 5 are required. Each feature should be fully described (at least a few full sentences for each)]
* Should be able to categorize books, movies/TV shows, and newspapers & magazines
* A system to check whether a specific item has been borrowed and if so, who borrowed the object and due dates.
* Graphical representation of all the bookshelves
* Waitlist for an item/ holding list
* A library member system


Want-to-have Features:
[These are features that you would like to have by the project due date, but you’re unsure whether you’ll hit all of them. A good final project would have perhaps half of these completed. At least 5 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Multiple copies of the same book
* A returning system
* Borrowing limit for each member (10)
* Book donation system
* Book shelves upgrade system (make the shelves larger)


Stretch Features:
[These are features that we agree a fully complete version of this program would have, but that you probably will not have time to implement. A good final project does not necessarily need to have any of these completed at all. At least 3 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Member tier list (lower limitation & can write reviews and stuff)
* Detailed member information (driver’s license ID, birthday, home address, etc.)
* Make it into a game
