Instructions:
When you run the program, a window will appear where you can either browse the catalog  or to access the members list
*You can close or switch between windows to go back and forth between shelves and items.


Browsing catalog:
1. The new window shows the different “shelves” available in the library.
2. Click on any shelf to browse the related items.
3. Click on any specific item to view its details and its availability.
   1. If the item is available then you should be able to borrow it by typing in your member ID#
   2. If the item is not available, then the expected day of return will be displayed.


Member list:
1. When view member list, the window will list out the member’s names and corresponding ID
2. Click on a name to change the name
3. Click “+” to add members, click “-” to delete members
 
Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:
[These are features that we agree you will definitely have by the project due date. A good final project would have all of these completed. At least 5 are required. Each feature should be fully described (at least a few full sentences for each)]
* Should be able to categorize books, movies/TV shows, and newspapers & magazines
* A system to check whether a specific item has been borrowed and if so, who borrowed the object and due dates.
* Graphical representation of all the bookshelves
* Waitlist for an item/ holding list
* A library member system


Want-to-have Features:
[These are features that you would like to have by the project due date, but you’re unsure whether you’ll hit all of them. A good final project would have perhaps half of these completed. At least 5 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Multiple copies of the same book
* A returning system
* Borrowing limit for each member
* Book donation system
* Book shelves upgrade system (make the shelves larger)


Stretch Features:
[These are features that we agree a fully complete version of this program would have, but that you probably will not have time to implement. A good final project does not necessarily need to have any of these completed at all. At least 3 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Member tier list (lower limitation & can write reviews and stuff)
* Detailed member information (driver’s license ID, birthday, home address, etc.)
* Make it into a game

* List the group members and describe how each member contributed to the completion of the final program. This could be classes written, art assets created, leadership/organizational skills exercises, or other tasks. Initially, this is how you plan on splitting the work.
